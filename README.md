:eight_spoked_asterisk: The new religion for the digital age.

Of course this seem very [discordianic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discordianism) *but* I argue that it really is 
aplicable to the way we design and create communication apps:
Among other things it provides this simple line of reasoning "Do I really treat the communication of my users as holy?" with all the implications
like "If it's holy I must give him full control (export)", "If it's holy I need to provide e2e encryption", etc.

And of course, having a good metaphysical reason to stick it to Facebook is quite a bonus in itself. :-)
